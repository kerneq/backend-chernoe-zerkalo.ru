1
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm gonna have to ask you
to switch that off for now.

2
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,400
Okay, thanks.

3
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,440
You know what it's kinda like?
It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

4
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,760
You know what I mean?
It's like a roller coaster.

5
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Try it, try it with me.

6
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
How tall-- How tall is the Eye?

7
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,240
How tall-- How tall is Big Ben?

8
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Since then, I've been working
as a technology correspondent

9
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,120
for about two years now.
It's been great.

10
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,760
Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,
TV reports and, like, you're like...

11
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,040
-No, just the website.
-Oh, just the website?

12
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,680
I mean, there's some video stuff,
but tech industry pieces mainly.

13
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,920
Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's--

14
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,120
So where have you been so far?

15
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,960
Travelling around the map
like Indiana Jones?

16
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
-Yeah.
-Where the adventure line

17
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
goes zigzagging all over the place.

18
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh...

19
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,640
But I started off, flew into Sydney,
went to Thailand.

20
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,480
-Oh, jealous.
-India. Yeah.

21
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Did Rome, went to Rome.

22
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,040
-Did the whole Europe vacation.
-Even I haven't done that.

23
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,280
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

24
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,680
It was awesome.
I went to Pamplona in Spain.

25
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,040
-Is that where they do the bull runs?
-Ran with the bulls.

26
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,960
-You ran with the bulls?
-I ran with the bulls.

27
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,760
-That's how I got this.
-Look at that!

28
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,160
You really are Indiana Jones.

29
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,280
Have you got your whip in your bag
and your hat?

30
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,760
I saved the world from the Nazis.
That was pretty cool.

31
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,640
I, you know, just... trying to do,
you know, shit I've never done before.

32
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Is that what you're doing on this trip?
You're, like, finding yourself?

33
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,960
Yeah, um... in a way. I mean, I--

34
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,280
Really to get away from the family home
is what I'm doing.

35
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh.

36
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,520
Yeah, that was-- Whatever, that's boring.

37
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, well,
I'm afraid Britain's pretty tame

38
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,280
as far as daredevil opportunities go.

39
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah? It's alright, it's the last leg
of the trip anyway so...

40
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm... unfortunately home next week.

41
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,480
-Not much time--
-Next week?

42
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,320
-Yeah.
-That's not very long.

43
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,040
-No, it's not.
-Mnh-mnh.

44
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,600
So... I could use some suggestions
on fun shit to do.

45
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,800
-Hmm. Fun shit to do?
-Fun shit to do.

46
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Ow! Ow!

47
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,480
Jesus!

48
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,920
Hello.

49
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,040
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

50
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Oh. Another battle scar.

51
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
Kind of.

52
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,560
Let me guess, you were, like,

53
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,440
totally shark fishing
in Cape Town, dude.

54
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Is that your best American accent?

55
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,680
-Yes.
-That's pretty good. No, um...

56
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,880
It was courtesy of Josh Peters,
high school dick.

57
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,320
He and I got into a fight in shop class.

58
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,680
And he hit me with this,
like, metal rod thing.

59
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,280
What an arsehole.

60
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
What an arsehole.

61
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,200
-That's terrible.
-I'm sorry.

62
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
Is that you or me?

63
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,960
Oh, it's gotta be you.

64
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,480
"Mom." You're so American.

65
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,480
Yes, I am.

66
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,440
Are you not gonna get that?

67
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,720
Okay, that was a little impersonal.

68
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
What, you wanna talk to her now?

69
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,760
-You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.
-Fair point.

70
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
I don't think so.

71
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
You hungry?

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,080
Wow, look at all these games.
You're, like, a gamer. Cool.

73
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,800
Of course I am. For my job.

74
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,520
What, a girl never beat you
at <i>Street Fighter</i>?

75
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,720
Is this--
Like, this is, like, your dating manual?

76
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,840
What?<i> The Singularity?</i>

77
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,040
It's when computers learn to outsmart man
like women did years ago.

78
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,600
Oh! Wow!

79
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,400
See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.

80
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
-You know?
-Really?

81
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
-Yeah.
-Well, that's what you call a joke?

82
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,080
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those.

83
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,920
-You guys have those here, right?
-Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,240
Ow!

85
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,600
That was a good joke.
That was a good joke.

86
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,880
Enjoy your Marmite.

87
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Whoa! Oh, my...

88
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,040
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?

89
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay, alright.

90
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,080
Alright, saved by mum.

91
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,320
The best way to actually just stop her
from calling is...

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't know, answer it.

93
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,840
Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms
I just don't wanna open right now, so...

94
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,800
She's worried. You're her son.
You've been travelling,

95
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,680
and I just think if you speak to her,
then...

96
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,120
Yeah, well, I still live at home
with her back in Syracuse.

97
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,960
-That's cool. That's fine.
-Yeah.

98
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,800
I was taking care of my dad.

99
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,320
Oh, shit. Is he...?

100
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
-...okay?
-No, he died.

101
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,760
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-Last year. No, it's okay.

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,720
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.

103
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,960
Oh, that must have been really...
uh... tough.

104
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,480
Yeah, he was my best friend.

105
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,720
Sometimes he'd just look at me
and wouldn't even know who I was.

106
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,560
Well, my mum, like, I don't even--
I don't know how to talk to her.

107
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,280
You know, I don't have that connection.
I don't even know where to start.

108
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,640
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.

109
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,000
Just to get away and make,
you know, all the memories that I can...

110
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
while I can.

111
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,480
And I know I gotta talk to her
and I gotta just...

112
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,520
But not on this.
You know, I just-- I'll deal with it.

113
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,040
I'll deal with it when I get back,
you know. I'll just...

114
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
You're a good guy, Cooper.

115
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
Call your mum.

116
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,880
Zero, zero, one, nine,
three, nine, two, nine.

117
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,720
No, I did not buy a pair of sandals
in Koh Samui last night

118
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,680
because I'm in--

119
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,840
And how long does that take?

120
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,560
Because I need to buy a ticket back
to America.

121
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,880
Oh, my God.

122
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,200
Mm-hmm.

123
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,280
Can I just say, this is the most blatant
cover story for a second hook-up ever?

124
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,040
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

125
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Alright. Don't forget your bag.

126
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,640
The bag, yep, my bag.
Alright. You are a top bird.

127
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know what that means, but I heard
somebody say it once, and you're it.

128
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,440
I got a plan.

129
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,240
Yeah. It's odd jobs.

130
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,240
-For who?
-For, like, it's an app.

131
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,200
You can kind of-- like, I've used it
all over when funds were low, so...

132
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,200
-Oh, there's some interesting ones.
-Pretty cool.

133
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,880
-"Thrillseekers wanted."
-Ooh.

134
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,480
-This looks right up your street.
-Okay.

135
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, four pound signs.
That's a biggie. That's good.

136
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,600
It's a little out of town.

137
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,360
And some kind of play test deal
for a company called Saitoo...

138
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,400
Saitogoo...

139
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
-SaitoGemu?
-SaitoGemu. Yeah.

140
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
They're huge.

141
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,640
-They're really big.
-Really?

142
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
-Horror games?
-Uh...

143
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Have you heard of...
Oh, what's one of theirs?

144
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
-<i>Harlech Shadow.</i>
-<i>Harlech Shadow?</i> Yes, I have.

145
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
I used to play that in my buddy
David Ludwig's basement

146
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
when we were, like, seventh grade.

147
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,160
Well, that's Shou Saito. It's his company.

148
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,840
-He's like this genius, super secretive.
-Okay.

149
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,080
And apparently,
they're working on this new project.

150
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.

151
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,920
Well, maybe if I play my cards right
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

152
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

153
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,640
You should take a photo.

154
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,880
Seriously, if you get a photo
of anything that they're working on,

155
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,000
that's a fuckload more money
than four pound signs.

156
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,880
Cool.

157
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,440
Well, where is this place?

158
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,400
Mr. Copper.

159
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,320
Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

160
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

161
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,760
Just Cooper is fine.

162
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,920
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

163
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

164
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,160
-Follow me.
-Oh, yeah.

165
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,280
-I'll just get my pack here.
-Rav will take care of that.

166
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,960
Oh, Rav will take care of that.
Okay, great.

167
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.

168
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,640
Rav kind of reminds me
of like an end-of-level boss.

169
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,960
You know,<i> haiukon.</i> Just...

170
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
-How was your journey?
-Great. Thanks.

171
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,680
-The car pick you up okay?
-Yeah.

172
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,880
Wow.

173
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
This way.

174
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,520
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

175
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,960
Wow.

176
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
Come on.

177
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.

178
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm gonna need your phone and anything
else you might use to send and receive.

179
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
-A little paranoid, don't you think?
-Can't be too careful.

180
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,200
Okay, there you go.

181
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,760
Wow, you really are paranoid.
Whoa!

182
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,440
It's white.

183
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,080
Um...

184
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,440
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

185
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,120
Actually, it's a pretty standard
NDA-disclaimer thing.

186
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Okay.

187
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,800
It's important that you realize there
is a small medical procedure involved.

188
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,840
Sorry, for a game?

189
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,440
Nothing permanent
and we don't harvest your kidneys,

190
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,920
-I promise.
-Okay.

191
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,960
It's no more invasive
than having your ears pierced.

192
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,800
"Confidential information, brain downloads
the game, duration, termination..."

193
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,760
Um... The signature page...

194
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
-Where do I sign?
-Oh.

195
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,240
-Signature. Yeah.
-There's a page missing.

196
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
-Okay.
-Just a moment.

197
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,840
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

198
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
What the fuck?

199
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
-All good?
-All good.

200
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,400
What we're working on is an interactive
augmented reality system.

201
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,840
-Like VR?
-More like layers on top of reality.

202
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,120
Oh.

203
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,600
Okay. Um...

204
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,240
Ow.

205
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
Um...

206
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
-What's that?
-We call this a mushroom.

207
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
-Like <i>Mario Brothers</i>?
-If you like.

208
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,400
-You're qualified to do this, right?
-I haven't killed anyone yet.

209
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
May I?

210
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,360
Yeah.

211
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,600
All done.

212
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,320
-That was it?
-See, I told you I'm good.

213
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,240
-No, don't worry, it's not permanent.
-Um...

214
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,920
Okay. What is this, like, some kind of
memory test or something like that?

215
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,520
-You'll find out.
-Oh, okay.

216
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,960
You might feel a slight twinge
as it initializes.

217
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Oh, okay.

218
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,880
Commencing at 5:38.

219
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,080
-You ready?
-Yes, sir!

220
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,840
Nearly there.

221
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,160
I thought I turned that off.

222
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,840
-All done. You feel okay?
-Uh-huh.

223
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,040
Feel great.

224
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,280
-Watch the targets.
-Okay.

225
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Um...

226
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,640
Is--

227
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
What do you see?

228
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,040
Like a-- um--

229
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,400
Like a video game gopher.

230
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,920
-Is it more detailed now?
-Yeah.

231
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,840
Yep, yeah.

232
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,600
-And now?
-Holy fuck!

233
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,480
Holy shit! He-- Fuck. He's right--

234
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,040
He's right-- He's right-- Can I--

235
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
Whoo!

236
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,800
<i>He's not real.</i>
<i>He's a sort of mental projection.</i>

237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,160
<i>-You can see him. I can't.</i>
<i>-You can't?</i>

238
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,600
Wow! Oh, okay.

239
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,440
Give him a whack.

240
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,480
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

241
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,160
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

242
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
-Mm-hmm.
-I've played it a million times. Okay.

243
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,000
Alright.

244
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,800
Here we go. Come on up.

245
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,640
Oh! Where you coming up?

246
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,040
No. No.

247
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
No.

248
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,720
Oh!

249
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Oh!

250
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,240
Alright. Stay down.

251
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,800
Oh! Okay.

252
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,160
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable.

253
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,080
Okay, bye. Bye.

254
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,040
-Is that it?
-Afraid so.

255
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,200
Oh.

256
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,400
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

257
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,080
Three.
No, no, no. 3D, super 3D. Like-- Yeah.

258
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,480
-Now this is just a limited test demo.
-That was a demo?

259
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,600
I think you should beta test
the full experience we're working on.

260
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,440
There'd be more money in it, of course.
If you're game?

261
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

262
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,680
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh!

263
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,720
-You must be our latest volunteer.
-Hi.

264
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,000
This is really great. Hi.

265
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,560
Hi.

266
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,200
I just-- I wanted to say
that the mole game, super fun.

267
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,880
Super fun... fun.

268
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,160
-Fun?
-Fun.

269
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,880
-Fun is good.
-Yeah. Oh.

270
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,840
-Playing games is good.
-Mm.

271
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,640
Your heart goes faster.

272
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,840
-You smile.
-Yeah.

273
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,280
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

274
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,040
Oh!

275
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,200
I have always liked
to make the player jump.

276
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,000
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

277
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,200
-Afterwards, you feel good.
-Yeah.

278
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,400
You glow.

279
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,320
Why?

280
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, um...

281
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
Because of the adrenaline rush.

282
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,600
-Yes.
-Yeah.

283
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,920
But mostly because you are still alive.

284
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,640
You have faced your greatest fears
in a safe environment.

285
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,920
It is a release of fear. It liberates you.

286
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah. I mean, totally.

287
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,720
What we are working on now

288
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,400
is the most personal
survival horror game in history.

289
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,000
Cool.

290
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,560
One that works out how to scare you
by using your own mind.

291
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,000
Whoa. That-- That sounds crazy.

292
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
Can't wait!

293
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,840
I'm uploading a neural net package.

294
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,640
Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

295
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,680
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

296
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,960
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

297
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,960
It's state of the art
intelligence software.

298
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,080
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity

299
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,120
and try and work out how best
to frighten you

300
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
and then adjust
to your experience accordingly.

301
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,480
-Whoa!

302
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,080
-Are you ready?
-Oh, yeah.

303
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,320
-Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
-Eyes closed.

304
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,800
-Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
-Okay.

305
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,880
It's uploading.
Five, four, three, two, one.

306
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,440
How are you feeling?

307
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,000
Um...

308
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,280
I feel good. I feel normal.

309
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,880
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

310
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,400
Are you ready to play?

311
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,520
Isn't this the <i>Harlech Shadow</i> house?

312
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,960
It's part of the estate.

313
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,560
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.
But, yeah, this was the model.

314
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,160
The layout was replicated for the game
and the texture scanned.

315
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,920
Wow!

316
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Very, very cool.

317
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,600
So what's the game, what do I do?

318
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
You don't have to do anything.

319
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,280
You just stay in here alone,

320
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,040
see how long you last
until you're too scared to continue.

321
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,400
So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

322
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,680
And I get paid for that?

323
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,400
I'll be back in the control room,
watching.

324
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,960
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

325
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,640
And now there's this.

326
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,800
-And what's this?
-It's an earpiece.

327
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,040
Oh!

328
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,800
Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I
will be in contact the whole time.

329
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,160
Oh, cool.

330
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,280
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

331
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,520
Now, nothing you'll see
can physically harm you.

332
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,040
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

333
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
Oh, okay.

334
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,280
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

335
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,520
-and stop the experiment.
-Okay.

336
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,360
Is there a safe word you can think of?

337
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,800
Something easy to remember in distress?

338
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,080
How about the word "stop"?

339
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,320
-Good choice. "Stop" it is.
-Yeah.

340
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

341
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
-Alright.
-You'll hear from me in a moment.

342
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,160
Just make yourself at home.

343
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Okay, all right. Well, take her easy.

344
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,000
<i>Harlech... Shadow.</i>

345
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,960
Is this real? Yeah, it's real.
That's real. It's really dead.

346
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,920
- <i> Cooper.</i>
- Oh, hey.

347
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,720
<i>-Are you hearing me?</i>
-Loud and clear.

348
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Oh!

349
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,680
<i>Reaching for the Dutch courage already,</i>
<i>I see.</i>

350
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,000
<i>-I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.</i>
-Lame.

351
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,120
<i>-Well, we need you with a clear head.</i>
-Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

352
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,240
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

353
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,720
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

354
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,960
-That's this place.
<i>-Full marks for observation.</i>

355
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Mm-hmm! Yep!

356
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Alright, there we go.

357
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,760
Ah!

358
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,600
-Oh, shit.
<i>-What's up?</i>

359
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,200
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

360
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,080
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

361
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

362
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,360
<i>Welcome to the 19th century.</i>
<i>No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.</i>

363
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,920
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

364
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,120
Probably were just bored out
of their gourds.

365
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,680
<i>Well, that's the leading theory</i>
<i>about ghost sightings.</i>

366
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,880
<i>The mind plays tricks</i>
<i>when less stimulated.</i>

367
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,160
<i>Fewer distractions,</i>
<i>people saw more ghosts.</i>

368
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,840
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

369
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
Well, they got literature, though.

370
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,800
That's pretty sweet, right?

371
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,400
Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual
last time that I read a book.

372
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,960
<i>To think people used to do this</i>
<i>on purpose.</i>

373
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,840
I know. Crazy. Why?

374
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,760
<i>-You know, I don't think I've--</i>
-Shh, alright?

375
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I need to get into some old-school
shit here. Concentrate.

376
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,480
<i> Pardon me.</i>

377
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>Can I point out your heart rate</i>
<i>just increased?</i>

378
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,280
Yeah. Well, it should have
cos there's a huge crazy spider.

379
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,840
<i>You see a spider?</i>

380
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,600
<i>-You don't-- you don't see that?</i>
-No.

381
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,360
Don't-- Don't walk. Don't--

382
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Holy shit!

383
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,320
<i>Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.</i>

384
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,840
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

385
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,320
<i>It's worked out you're</i>
<i>an arachnophobe quickly.</i>

386
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,440
<i>It's probing for weak spots.</i>

387
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
God damn it.

388
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,600
Fucker!

389
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,920
Yeah!

390
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,640
Um...

391
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,680
Okay.

392
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,480
Yeah, well, yeah.

393
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,160
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

394
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,800
It's good. It's good graphics.

395
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,800
It's good, uh-- Yeah.

396
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,360
Weak sauce.

397
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,280
<i>-What is it?</i>
-Just--

398
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,080
Nothing. Nothing.

399
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,960
Here with the figures. There's a--
No. There's a light on...

00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,040
now, in the...

401
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,600
Can you... zoom in and--
zoom in on it?

402
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,000
And you can see what I'm talking about.
Whoa!

403
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,960
-<i>Cooper...</i>
-And now there's-- Shh!

404
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,400
There's a guy in the window.
That wasn't...

405
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,240
Yeah.

406
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,880
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

407
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,080
Which is the--

408
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,720
Mm-hmm.

409
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,560
Yeah, there's a--

410
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,920
Just leaky pipes.

411
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,800
I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like--

412
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,800
Holy fuck!

413
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,880
Fuck!

414
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,080
Oh! Oh!

415
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,960
Okay.

416
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,800
That got me. You got me.

417
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
<i>- What are you seeing?</i>

418
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,720
Like a creepy fucking guy.

419
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,680
Wow, just...

420
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

421
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,760
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

422
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,120
-It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
<i>-Sorry?</i>

423
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,680
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

424
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,120
<i>The system could be mining some</i>
<i>of your personal memories for texture.</i>

425
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,680
<i>Was Josh Peters</i>
<i>someone you were scared of?</i>

426
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,320
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

427
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,440
I wasn't scared of him,
but he was a bully and--

428
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,880
Man! Take a couple of Krav Maga classes
and I'd be ready.

429
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,880
I'd be ready!

430
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,240
<i>Kali ma! </i>Dah!

431
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,280
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

432
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,920
I'd offer you some, but I don't think
you can drink it so...

433
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,680
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

434
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,720
Catch ya later, Peters.

435
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,040
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

436
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

437
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,160
I was in France.
I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

438
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,760
and they had this wine,
like, grape-stomping festival.

439
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,520
Now that,
that wine was good. I know that.

440
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,520
<i>You're being discursive.</i>

441
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,640
-What is discursive? Discursive?
<i>-Talkative.</i>

442
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,200
-Mm-hmm.
<i>-Rambling.</i>

443
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,640
Is that a problem?

444
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,400
<i>People sometimes talk more</i>
<i>when they're afraid.</i>

445
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,680
<i>Helps compensate for the fear.</i>

446
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,320
<i>-Masks it, too.</i>
-Oh, yeah?

447
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,400
<i>Similar to when you've got the TV on</i>
<i>late at night.</i>

448
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,640
<i>The voices make you feel less alone.</i>

449
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,440
<i>Even though you are alone.</i>

450
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,720
You aren't scaring me, Katie.

451
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,800
<i>Pity.</i>

452
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,680
Is there like a refrigerator here?

453
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,360
<i>- There's some snacks in the cupboard.</i>

454
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,480
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

455
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,320
Mo! Alright.

456
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,880
Okay, ginger snaps.

457
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,040
Let's see.

458
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

459
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,440
Now... um...

460
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,280
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he?

461
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,680
Yeah, that's how this works.

462
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,240
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old--

463
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,760
Fuck!

464
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,440
Oh, God.

465
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,320
<i>-What the hell is that?</i>
-What do you see?

466
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,080
Holy shit!

467
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,080
A fucking-- Uh...

468
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,160
Hard to explain.

469
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,960
It's like a huge-ass spider with a face
and dicks coming out of his mouth.

470
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
It's...

471
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,400
Peters. Peters is inside.

472
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,080
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

473
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,560
Ah, Katie!
Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?

474
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,120
<i>- I think that's all you.</i>
- I'm so fucked up!

475
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,440
<i>God! Fuck!</i>

476
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,000
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

477
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,240
Yeah--

478
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,920
Sorry, can you say again?

479
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,440
Katie, hello?

480
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,360
Damn it, Katie!

481
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,440
Whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

482
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,640
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

483
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,360
That you guys?

484
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,880
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.

485
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,440
Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,200
Fuck it, man!

487
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,800
Come on!

488
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
You're in danger.

489
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,760
Sonja?

490
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,720
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

491
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,040
This-- very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

492
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,000
I am-- Wow! Wow!

493
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,640
You look so real.
You're, like, just like her.

494
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,280
I mean, wow.

495
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,200
Except... you're just unfortunately not...
um...

496
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,000
-Cooper, what are you doing?
-Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

497
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,200
-Cooper, you're in danger.
-Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

498
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,920
You're fucking real.
You are real. You're real.

499
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,600
-Cooper, you're in--
-You're Sonja. You're actually here.

500
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,480
-Are you actually here right now?
-I'm real. I'm actually here.

501
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,920
-God.
-And we have to go.

502
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,720
-You have to listen to me.
-How are you here?

503
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
You know that photo that you sent me?

504
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,080
I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

505
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,600
for a computer brain interface last year.

506
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
How are you real? I don't--

507
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,520
Okay, fuck. I don't--

508
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
They brought you here!

509
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,240
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here,

510
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,880
and they're trying to fuck with me.
Nice try, good try.

511
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,440
I get it. It's part of the test.

512
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,920
His patent got rejected outright.
They said it was insane, it was dangerous.

513
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,920
Wow. Really? How much are they paying you?
Honestly. Cos you're killing it right now.

514
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,880
-Have they given you something?
-Sorry, I thought you were fake.

515
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,400
But now I know you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

516
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,880
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.

517
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,480
-Cooper, what I want to do is--
-We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

518
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,520
-Cooper!
-Sonja, relax, okay?

519
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,640
Give it up.
I know, the jig's up, okay? Let it go.

520
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,920
Look, Cooper, there's more.

521
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,320
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

522
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,720
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid odd jobs app.

523
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,720
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

524
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,480
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you,

525
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,720
it's dangerous,
and we really have to go now, Cooper.

526
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,840
Okay, okay. Alright.

527
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,680
-Well, if your story's true...
-Cooper.

528
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,240
-then how'd you find me?
-What?

529
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,600
How'd you know where I am?

530
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,400
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

531
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,880
Yeah, really?

532
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,280
No, no, no, no.
How'd you find me here? This place.

533
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,000
-I tracked you.
-You tracked me?

534
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Yeah, with your GPS on your phone.
Find My Friends.

535
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,840
Find My Friends? That would've worked,
but they took my phone.

536
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,440
And it's in a building, like, a mile away.
So, yeah, nice try.

537
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,720
That's right.

538
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,040
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity <i>that!</i>

539
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,120
Look, all I'm saying is that

540
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,680
I think that you could've come up
with a better story,

541
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,960
it could have been funny or...

542
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,960
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

543
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,720
Do you ever wonder
how your bank account got hacked?

544
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,640
What are you doing?

545
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,040
-I cloned your card as you were asleep.
-Whoa. Okay.

546
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

547
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,640
I drew your attention to this job.

548
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,800
Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay?
It's not funny.

549
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,400
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

550
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,640
-But you called me, and I led you here...
-Sonja.

551
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,400
-You know what?
-...like a breadcrumb trail.

552
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,920
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

553
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,880
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife--

554
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,560
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, okay?

555
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,760
Fuck!

556
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,720
What the fuck?

557
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Oh, fuck! Oh!

558
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,640
Holy fuck!

559
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,440
Stop!

560
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,440
Fuck!

561
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,840
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

562
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,520
- <i> Cooper.</i>
- Katie!

563
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,920
<i>-Katie!</i>
-Cooper.

564
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,240
<i>-Katie!</i>
-Cooper, what's happening?

565
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,400
What the fuck happened?

566
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
<i>What's happening? We've been talking.</i>
<i>You've not been responding.</i>

567
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,800
-You said I wouldn't feel anything!
<i>-What are you seeing? What's there?</i>

568
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,920
-Fuck! She's gone now.
<i>-Who's gone?</i>

569
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,760
Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

570
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,440
There's a knife in my arm!

571
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,440
-In my shoulder.
<i>-Cooper, who was there?</i>

572
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,680
-Fuck... Sonja.
<i>-Who?</i>

573
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,000
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking-- She stabbed me.

574
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,120
-She had a fucking knife.
<i>-Nothing can harm you, Cooper.</i>

575
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,320
-No, no, no, no. She was solid.
<i>-No, she can't have been.</i>

576
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,800
She-- I was stabbed! I would know!

577
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,360
<i>Nothing you see can harm</i>
<i>or even touch you.</i>

578
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,120
<i>It's purely audio-visual.</i>

579
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,440
<i>-There's no physical sensation.</i>
-Fuck! Yes, there was!

580
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,800
<i>-Cooper, you need to calm down.</i>
-I know because I felt it, okay?

581
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,000
I felt her arm, it was warm,

582
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,240
and I felt her fucking stab me
in the shoulder.

583
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,520
<i>- That's not possible.</i>
- Oh, my God.

584
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,760
<i>-It's not possible, Cooper.</i>
-Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

585
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,920
<i>Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.</i>

586
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
<i>-Unless, I mean...</i>
-Oh, God. Unless what?

587
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,840
<i>I don't know. The neuron net,</i>
<i>it could have maybe worked out</i>

588
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,400
<i>some means</i>
<i>of replicating physical experiences,</i>

589
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,600
<i>-but that would be unprecedented.</i>
-Jesus Christ.

590
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,760
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

591
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,240
I want out. Just pull me out now.

592
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,480
Stop, stop, stop.
Safe word. Fucking stop!

593
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,440
<i>-Okay, okay, just let us work it out.</i>
-Oh, God.

594
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,560
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

595
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,040
<i>Cooper,</i>
<i>do not attempt to remove that yourself.</i>

596
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,960
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

597
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,840
Stop that, that could kill you!

598
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,040
Just stay calm!

599
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,160
Is that Shou?

600
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,920
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

601
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,560
<i>Okay, Cooper.</i>
<i>We're gonna commence with deactivation.</i>

602
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,320
Oh, that's great news.

603
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,360
<i>We need you to follow instructions</i>
<i>and make it to the access point.</i>

604
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,680
The access point? Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

605
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,320
-Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!
<i>-Just one more level.</i>

606
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,520
<i>- Trust me.</i>
- Okay.

607
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,400
<i>- Left at the top.</i>

608
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,000
-Okay, which door?
-<i>Room at the end.</i>

609
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,680
<i>What is it?</i>

610
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,320
There's gonna be something behind there.
I can feel it.

611
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
-Something like...
<i>-Like what?</i>

612
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,920
Some personal fucked-up shit.

613
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,280
Like... I don't know, I could feel it
digging around in my head.

614
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,120
<i>Cooper, get to the door.</i>

615
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,120
It's gonna be like my mum,
I don't know, dead.

616
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,360
<i>-Your mum?</i>
-Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

617
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,160
<i>-Your mother is not in there.</i>
-You're not in control of this!

618
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,960
It's in my head.
It fucking knows. It knows.

619
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,240
-It knows!
<i>-It knows what?</i>

620
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,400
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

621
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,240
<i>Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there.</i>

622
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,520
<i>-Now open the door.</i>
-Oh, my God.

623
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,680
<i>It's the only way I can get you out.</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

624
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,000
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

625
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,840
<i>Whatever's in there cannot harm you.</i>

626
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,800
<i>But I can't get you out</i>
<i>unless you open that door, Cooper.</i>

627
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,800
Okay.

628
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,720
<i>Would you kindly open the door?</i>

629
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,440
Here we go. Here we go.

630
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,560
Okay.

631
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,680
Okay, okay, I'm in the room.
Where's the access point?

632
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,680
<i>Access point?</i>

633
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,680
<i>-There is no access point.</i>
-What?

634
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,720
<i>I'm fucking with you, Cooper.</i>

635
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,400
<i>I told you to come up here</i>
<i>to see if we've broken you enough</i>

636
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,000
<i>to obey instructions without question.</i>

637
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,560
<i>-And we have.</i>
-Oh, no, no, no.

638
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,080
Katie, come on.
Katie, come on, let me out!

639
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,040
Katie, let me out, come on!
What the fuck!

640
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,640
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, what are you doing to me?

641
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,320
-Why are you doing this?
<i>-You thought you'd see your mother.</i>

642
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,560
-Oh, fuck!
<i>-What does she look like?</i>

643
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,680
<i>Your mother, can you describe her face?</i>

644
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,560
<i>Her hair colour?</i>

645
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,040
She--

646
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,240
<i>Is she tall, short, fat, thin?</i>

647
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,200
<i>-Where did you grow up?</i>
-She--

648
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,880
<i>What's your favourite band?</i>
<i>Your favourite flavour ice cream?</i>

649
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,200
<i>The name of the girl who stabbed you?</i>

650
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,840
<i>You don't know any of these things,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

651
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,360
<i>Don't you think that's odd?</i>

652
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,680
It's fucking taking my memories!

653
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,120
<i>Overwriting them, technically.</i>

654
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
Fuck.

655
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,960
<i>Look in the mirror behind you.</i>

656
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,520
<i>Do you recognize yourself?</i>

657
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,800
<i>Do you even know who you're looking at?</i>

658
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,800
<i>Soon you won't be anything.</i>
<i>You'll be just like your dad.</i>

659
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,640
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

660
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,320
<i>-That's what really scares you, isn't it?</i>
-Stop it.

661
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,120
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
<i>-You're going the same place he did.</i>

662
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,840
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

663
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,760
<i>-You're going nowhere.</i>
-Shut up! Shut up.

664
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,200
<i> You should have called mum.</i>
<i>She's all that's left.</i>

665
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,240
<i>-You abandoned her.</i>
-No, no, no, no!

666
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,200
Get out of my head!

667
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,760
<i>You'll never see her again.</i>
<i>You'll never speak to her again.</i>

668
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,520
<i>-Never see her face.</i>
-Get out of my fucking head!

669
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,080
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!

670
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,480
<i>You're a bad son.</i>
<i>You'll never see your mother again.</i>

671
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,600
<i>- You're going nowhere.</i>

672
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,920
<i>Straight into oblivion.</i>

673
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,320
<i>You deserve it.</i>
<i>You should have called her.</i>

674
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,440
Get out of my fucking head!

675
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,200
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

676
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,680
Get it out of my fucking head!

677
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,360
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?
I just need to connect.

678
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,760
Get it out of my head!

679
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,520
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

680
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,120
Oh, my God. Where am I?

681
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,880
Who are you?

682
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,600
I can't stop it.

683
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,480
I don't know who I am.
So I-- So I need to go home.

684
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,440
The interface has data tendrils
like roots.

685
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,120
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

686
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,240
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

687
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,360
I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

688
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
But I-- But I don't know who I am.

689
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,320
I don't know-- I don't know who I am.

690
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,040
I don't know who I am.

691
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,320
I don't know.

692
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,200
On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologize.

693
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,560
Who are you?
What have you done to me?

694
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,000
-What have you done to me?
-Put him with the others, please.

695
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,360
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

696
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,680
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

697
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,080
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
No, don't, don't!

698
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,200
Don't! Don't!

699
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,400
Stop! Stop!

700
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,320
No!

701
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,680
Oh, fuck.

702
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,880
That was one second.

703
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,320
Either he's super susceptible to this
or the software is way too powerful still.

704
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,720
It's jumped from zero to 18K
in five milliseconds...

705
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,160
<i>I'm sorry. The experience was</i>
<i>more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.</i>

706
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,280
<i>I hope you can forgive us.</i>

707
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,640
<i> ...all luggage under the seat</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

708
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,360
<i>All electronic devices</i>
<i>should now be turned off and stowed</i>

709
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,200
<i>as they may interfere with the aircraft's</i>
<i>navigational and communication....</i>

710
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,160
Mum?

711
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,800
Mum?

712
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,320
I have to call him.

713
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,440
Mum?

714
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,200
Why did Cooper go?

715
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,440
-I--
-Mom, I'm right here. I'm--

716
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,760
-I'm right here, Mum.
-I have to call Cooper.

717
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,600
I have to call
and make sure that he's safe.

718
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,640
I have to call him. I have to call him.
I have to call him.

719
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,600
Mum?

720
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,520
Mum!

721
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,000
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!

722
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,600
-What happened?
-His phone rang.

723
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,200
-You didn't take it off him?
-Yes, but...

724
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,240
-The signals interfere.
-I know I switched it off.

725
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,320
Maybe he did something
while I was out of the room.

726
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,200
An oversight. Won't happen again.

727
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,360
The incoming signal must have interfered
with the upload sequence.

728
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,520
Every synapse in his brain lit up at once.

729
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,960
Then went dead. Like that.

730
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,560
You said he shouted something.
What was it?

731
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
"Mum."

732
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,840
-Make a note of that.
-Yes.
