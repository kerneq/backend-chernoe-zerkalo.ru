1
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,080
Kenny?
Big spillage on table four. Sorry.

2
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,920
Okay. All right.

3
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,360
Excuse me.

4
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
Someone forgot this.

5
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Oh, thank you!

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,000
-What do you say?
-Thank you.

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,160
-It's all right.
-She forgets everything. Thanks again.

8
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
She was some yoga teacher, proper bendy.
Look. Look.

9
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Jesus! Fuck!
What, she sent that to you, did she?

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
Double naughty.

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,840
Jog on.

12
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,000
Linds!

13
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,880
Linds, where's my laptop?

14
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,160
-Don't be a bell end!
-Use your own.

15
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,680
-Mine's bust. Yours has gone all frozen.
-What did you do?

16
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
-I was trying to put on this film thing.
-What film thing?

17
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Don't know. Some programme
lets you watch free films.

18
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,080
While I was trying to put it on,
then it locked up.

19
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,600
-Look, it's not my fault.
-Don't take it again. It's not yours.

20
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,640
-Oh, fix mine when you've done that.
-"Fix mine when you've done that."

21
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,600
- Stop nicking my Cokes!
- Whatever.

22
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,680
Did you draw that yourself, Kenny?

23
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

24
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Bye.

25
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,160
- Bye, Kenny.
- Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow.

26
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
You're mental.

27
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,320
-You're mental.
-You're a thief.

28
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,000
Love? Kenny? What do you think?

29
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,480
- I'm still not used to the colour.
- It's nice.

30
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
Yeah?

31
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,960
Do me a favour
and prison-guard your sister, will you?

32
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,640
I won't be late. Probably.

33
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,480
Oh, my God! He's outside.
There's a lasagna thing in the freezer.

34
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
I love you.

35
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
Have you seen my keys?

36
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,040
You okay, Ken? Love?

37
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
Yeah, fine.

38
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Ha!

39
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,800
-Morning, Kenny.
-Hi.

40
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,240
-Kenny?
-Feeling really sick.

41
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
-You've only just got here.
-I know but think I might throw up.

42
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,200
Okay, just next time can you-- ?

43
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,320
Whoa! Easy, knobber.

44
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Come on.

45
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,440
-It's fragile.
-What is it?

46
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,560
They told me to do that.

47
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,520
Is that it? What do I do now?

48
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,040
I can't really help you.

49
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
What do I have to do?

50
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,520
Just whatever they say
and once you've done that, you're out.

51
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,280
They let you off.

52
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
Hello?

53
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,480
Del-- Delivery.

54
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,360
Wrong room.

55
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
They said 121.

56
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,040
No, there's no delivery here.

57
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,560
- But they said--
- I haven't ordered anything.

58
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a cake.

59
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,440
- What cake?
- I don't know. I think it's a sponge.

60
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,840
I didn't order a cake
so just take it back to the bakery

61
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,880
-and tell them they got it wrong.
-Look, if I--

62
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,320
I don't want the cake.
So go away or I call the front desk.

63
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,080
I will kick that cake
up your fucking arse.

64
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
M-Mindy sent me.

65
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,520
-What is this? Where's Mindy?
-I was just told to give this to you.

66
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
-Mindy told you?
-No.

67
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,720
-You said "Mindy."
-That's what they told me to say.

68
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,000
Get inside.

69
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,440
So what are you saying?
Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

70
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,800
No, uh, I don't know.
It-- they-- it was them.

71
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,320
Them? They? Who the fuck are you on about?

72
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,600
-The people.
-What fucking people?

73
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,840
The phone people.
The people on the phone.

74
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,280
They told me to bring the cake,
and they're leaving texts on my phone,

75
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,960
-and then I do what they say.
-Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

76
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,720
Just breathe through your nose.

77
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,440
Through your nose. Okay?

78
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
Good. Now, just show me what they said.
On your phone.

79
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,040
-Show me the text.
-Okay, well, um... This.

80
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,040
-I should--
-Shut up. Just let me.

81
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,520
What the fuck is this?

82
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,840
-Who are these people?
-I don't know.

83
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,600
-Who are you?
-I'm not them.

84
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,000
They send me messages,
and I do what they say.

85
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
Why? Why would you do that?

86
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
Is it them?

87
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
-They said I had to do that.
-Jesus Christ!

88
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,280
Okay, okay.

89
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,440
They're saying they just need us
to follow their instructions,

90
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,640
and everything will be okay. Okay?

91
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,440
Shit!

92
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
They're saying we have to do it
together.

93
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,080
-What do we have to do?
-Just take the cake somewhere.

94
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,000
They sent me an address.
A map coordinate thing.

95
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,560
-And there's a car we need to get.
-A car? What sort of car?

96
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,240
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

97
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,680
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

98
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,400
Why both of us?

99
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,240
I don't know!

100
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,840
Just let me deal
with my fucking shoe, please.

101
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,080
What have they said?

102
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,080
They say, "Go with him. Take the package."

103
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,640
Okay.

104
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,240
"V760 DHM."

105
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,480
V760 DHM.

106
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm getting fucking number blindness here.

107
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
That's it.

108
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,400
All right. They said
the keys are on the back. Okay.

109
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Look, maybe you better drive.
Do you drive?

110
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,040
-I mean, I had a drink back there.
-I can't. I can-- I can drive.

111
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

112
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

113
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,120
Okay, you've got a sat nav
on your phone?

114
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,360
Yep.

115
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,760
Here it is. Punch that in.

116
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,200
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

117
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,640
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

118
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,120
So I'm guessing they got some shit on you
that they're threatening to put out?

119
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
With me, it's...

120
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,600
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

121
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,120
I was waiting for a prostitute.

122
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,560
Escort, hooker,
whatever they call them now.

123
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,840
I got a family, which is great.

124
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,480
You get bored.

125
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,800
I mean, when I was young,
I used to like...

126
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,760
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

127
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,800
For old times' sake, I don't know.

128
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,520
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

129
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,840
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

130
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,960
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

131
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,120
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

132
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,720
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

133
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,360
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

134
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,840
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

135
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,320
Sucked up the whole hard drive
like an audit.

136
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,080
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

137
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,240
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

138
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,160
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

139
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,360
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

140
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,000
Custody, she'd win.

141
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,720
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

142
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,320
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

143
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,720
They filmed me.

144
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,200
-Filmed you...
-Through my computer camera.

145
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,600
-What, like, filmed you?
-Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

146
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,000
-Like sex?
-No. Like, you... you know.

147
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,000
Jerking off.
Jerking off to porn or something?

148
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,280
Well, everyone does that.

149
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,080
-The fucking pope probably does that.
-They're gonna put it everywhere.

150
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,840
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

151
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,720
-Oh, shit the fuck!
-What? What?

152
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,520
-How long's that light been on?
-What light?

153
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,880
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

154
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I won't be a minute.

155
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,280
Unleaded. Unleaded.

156
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Oh, bugger!

157
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,880
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

158
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,400
Have you got any money?

159
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,680
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

160
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,720
-Visa card--
-Just the number!

161
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,120
-Uh... 3109.
-Okay, go!

162
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,320
Pump four!

163
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,240
-What's your pump number?
-Four.

164
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
-You want some chocolate?
-No.

165
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,080
-It's two for one this week.
-I'm okay.

166
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,240
31.89.

167
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Pop your PIN in.

168
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,840
- If you're sure you don't mind?
- No, no, of course not.

169
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,560
-I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
-Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

170
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,640
-Okay.
-Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

171
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay.

172
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,360
This is, uh...

173
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,080
my nephew.

174
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,600
Nice to meet you.

175
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,040
-Kenny.
-Kenny. I'm Karen.

176
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,280
We're both Ks.

177
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm head of the PTA at Theo
and Cassie's school, for my sins.

178
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,800
Just roped poor Hector into sorting out
the catering for the quiz night.

179
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,440
Been the usual balls up.

180
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,640
Listen, we better get this guy
to the station.

181
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,280
His train's... So we better go.

182
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,080
-Cansroad Station?
-Yeah.

183
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,280
Oh, couldn't drop me
at the end of my road, could you?

184
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,760
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

185
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,240
It's the bus otherwise and that goes
all the way around the common.

186
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,640
-We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
-Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

187
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,480
I'll hop out.
Hardly need to slow down. Yeah?

188
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,440
-Yep. Sure. Let's go.
-Brilliant. Thanks!

189
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,160
I'll just get in the back.

190
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

191
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
-What's that? Present?
-It's a cake.

192
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,880
-It's just a-- it's a cake for Penny.
-Oh, lucky her.

193
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,960
So how is Penny?

194
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,200
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

195
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,560
She's good.

196
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,840
-She still planning to get back to work?
-Yeah. Yep.

197
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,640
- I mean, how old's Theo now?
- Uh... He's seven.

198
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,400
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

199
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,160
Yeah, he had a good time.

200
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,560
Oh, Anna's having a sleepover.

201
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,000
Cassie's probably already told you
about it.

202
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,880
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad!

203
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,840
So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

204
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,920
-Sorry. What?
-Are you going home or...?

205
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,600
-Uh...
-Train. Birmingham.

206
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,680
Yeah. Uh...

207
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,800
-Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
-Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

208
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,400
-What part are you?
-South.

209
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,040
South.

210
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,680
-Mainly.
-Right.

211
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,520
Have you always lived there?
'Cos you don't sound--

212
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,720
I don't have the accent, no.
Everyone says that--

213
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,200
that... I don't have the accent.

214
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,560
Didn't grow up there though.
I grew up somewhere else.

215
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Like London. I grew up in London.

216
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
Okay.

217
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,680
And is your mum and dad
on Hector's side or Penny's?

218
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,080
Someone crossing! Crossing!

219
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,280
Sorry about that! Can't miss his train.

220
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
This is me.

221
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,760
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

222
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,400
-Yes, of course.
-Bye, then.

223
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,040
-Bye, Karen.
-Bye.

224
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,440
We're gonna make it, okay?

225
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,160
It's this junction.

226
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,920
-What? This one?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,480
You sure this is it?

228
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,760
"Look in the cake."

229
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,440
Let's look in the cake.

230
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,000
Look in the cake.

231
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,880
In the cake, I suppose.

232
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
I got something.

233
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
What the fuck?

234
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,040
Oh, my God.

235
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,760
"Five minutes to decide."

236
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,600
Decide what?

237
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,000
-"Who is driver?"
-"Who is robber?"

238
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,120
Oh, no. No.

239
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,040
-W-w-we can't. We...
-I'm driver.

240
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,400
You said you can't drive. I'm driver.

241
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,200
I'll be right here
with the engine running.

242
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
We-- We can't. We--

243
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,120
Then how else are we gonna deal
with this, Kenny?

244
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,600
-I'm not--
-Listen to me.

245
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,720
-I'm not--
-Shut up and listen!

246
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,240
Hat and sunglasses.
No one's going to ID you.

247
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,760
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

248
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,480
Shut up! Point two,
in a robbery, staff are trained.

249
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,520
I am not--

250
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,200
They are trained to hand over the cash.

251
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,960
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.
No resistance. It looked easy.

252
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,120
It's not easy.

253
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,200
I know it isn't easy, but what the fuck
else are we gonna do? Hey?

254
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,120
This gets out, I will lose my kids.

255
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,920
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

256
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,040
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

257
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,840
-I only looked at pictures and--
-And beat one off on camera?

258
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,520
That's what they got, yeah?

259
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,520
Your hot little face, blurred fist,
dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

260
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,560
Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,
Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

261
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,160
And her friends.
All eyes on you, giving it that.

262
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

263
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,360
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

264
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,280
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

265
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,120
Pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

266
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,600
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

267
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,720
It'd be glued to your name,
a fucking stain on you.

268
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,040
I'd hang myself if that was me.

269
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,280
Crack my fucking neck
at the first opportunity.

270
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,680
They just want the money,
so go in there and do it.

271
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,440
-You'll drive away.
-I am not gonna drive away.

272
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,840
I'm gonna be sat here
with the engine running.

273
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,720
I can't. I can't.

274
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,000
-You can. You can.
-I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

275
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,160
- You can.
- I can't.

276
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,560
We don't have much time, Kenny.

277
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,360
-It's not real. This is not real.
-You can do this.

278
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,480
Keep it together.
Please hold it together.

279
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,080
-Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!
-Okay.

280
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,240
Have you got a bag?

281
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,000
Glasses. Breathe through your nose.

282
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Give me money.

283
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,880
Just give me money!

284
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,360
-Yes. Okay.
-Lots of it. I need lots of it.

285
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,480
Sh-should I use your bag?

286
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,400
Take it.

287
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm going to pass this back
to you now. Is that okay?

288
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,880
There was some bloke standing there
on his phone freaking me out.

289
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,640
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.

290
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,440
Go faster.

291
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,400
Speed limit's 40.
Wanna get stopped for speeding now?

292
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,880
-Oh, shit.
-Fuck!

293
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
That's a siren.

294
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,640
Shh! Shush.

295
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,440
-Let's go!
-Shut up.

296
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,320
Wait, wait.

297
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,800
Come on.

298
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,240
Come on.

299
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,600
Okay.

300
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,760
We're okay.

301
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,800
We should text them, no?
Tell them we got the money.

302
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,200
-They say we got to take it somewhere.
-Where?

303
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,400
This is it.

304
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,400
Yeah.

305
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,840
Here we go.

306
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,760
"Final instruction."

307
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,720
"Take car away and destroy."

308
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,120
Destroy the car.

309
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,240
"Just you alone."

310
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,000
Why just you?

311
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,120
I got to take the money
somewhere over there.

312
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,040
Why? Why have I got to do it?

313
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,360
Fuck knows.

314
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,080
So...

315
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,640
You better go, yeah?

316
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,000
Hey, you got this far, haven't you?

317
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,440
Just drop it off. That's it.

318
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,240
You'll be all right.

319
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,320
Hey, listen, Kenny. Look.
I'm sorry about-- just back there.

320
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,160
Shouting at you. Calling you stuff.

321
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,120
I'm an all right bloke really.
I swear I am, when it's--

322
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,240
When stuff's normal.

323
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,320
You take care, yeah?

324
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,960
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, hang on.

325
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,200
They told me I had
to set this thing off first.

326
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Okay.

327
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,600
You got the prize money?

328
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,960
-Prize money?
-You know, for the... fight?

329
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,360
How is there a fight?

330
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,120
-They didn't tell you?
-No.

331
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,720
We've got to fight...

332
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
...or else they post everything
they've got on us.

333
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,240
Winner takes the money.

334
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,560
We've got to do it.

335
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,960
I mean...

336
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,440
They're watching.

337
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,640
What sort of fight?
How do we know when it's over?

338
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,000
How... How do we know who's won?

339
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:03,000
I don't know about you,
but my life's over if this gets out.

340
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,000
Fucking over.

341
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,960
What they get you for?

342
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,880
I just looked at some photos.

343
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,560
That's all.
I just looked at one or two photos.

344
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,960
Yeah.

345
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,600
Yeah, yeah,
I just looked at pictures too.

346
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,360
How young were they? In the pictures?

347
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,720
How young?

348
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,760
Yeah.

349
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,640
Well, me too.

350
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,040
Look, mate. Don't. Please.

351
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,880
Please.

352
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,880
Please.

353
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,720
Mindy?

354
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,680
Is that what you've become?

355
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,880
-A dirty, sick, disgusting pervert?
-Hey, relax!

356
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,640
Look at me! Is that what you are?

357
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,200
<i>What did you do, Kenny?</i>
<i>They're saying it's kids!</i>

358
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,400
<i>That you've been looking at kids!</i>

359
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,840
<i>And Lindsey saw it.</i>
<i>There's a video of you.</i>

360
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,440
<i>All of her friends have got it!</i>

361
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,840
<i>Kids, Kenny! Tell me that's not true!</i>
