1
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,080
<i> Belinda Carlisle there with one</i>
<i>of the biggest hits of 1987 so far.</i>

2
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
<i>Gotta love that track!</i>
<i>Coming up next in just a moment...</i>

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,400
Could you please stop it?
I just wanna have some fun, okay?

4
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,560
Kelly, come on.

5
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,080
-Kelly.
-I'm still walking, Wes.

6
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,320
We've only got a couple of hours
so let's, uh... let's use it.

7
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I am using it.

8
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,440
Hey.

9
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
You're good at this.

10
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,440
It's, uh... got different endings.

11
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Depending on if you're in one
or two player.

12
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Uh-huh?

13
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,400
- It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

14
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,600
Do you wanna play <i>Top Speed</i>?

15
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh, no.

16
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,160
Thank you.
I just wanna get my bearings a bit.

17
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
Uh... okay.

18
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
-See you around?
-Mm-hmm.

19
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,440
Go along with whatever I say.

20
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,040
-Sorry?
-Whatever I say, go along with it.

21
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,320
Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

22
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,320
-Do I have to red light you?
-Two hours 35.

23
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,880
-There's not much time left.
-Wes.

24
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Look...

25
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,400
-Last week, we had the most amazing--
-Last week was last week.

26
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,040
I need to talk with my friend here, okay?
Haven't seen her in a while.

27
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
Wes, she's sick.

28
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
Like "six months to live" sick.

29
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
Five, actually.

30
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,800
I need to catch up with her.
Private time.

31
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

33
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,560
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

34
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,120
See you around?

35
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,840
Sure.

36
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,000
Sorry for killing you.

37
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,040
The whole "six months to live" thing?

38
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,880
Sorry. Five.

39
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Five was a nice touch.

40
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,920
-Kelly.
-Yorkie.

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,480
-Yurgie?
-Yorkie.

42
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
Like the dog breed?

43
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Yeah.

44
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,360
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,840
-Met him at the Quagmire so...
-What's the Quagmire?

46
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,800
If you don't already know
what the Quagmire is,

47
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,840
you probably don't wanna know.

48
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
No?

49
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,120
You want another one?

50
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
-Oh, no, I--
-Yeah, you do. Come on.

51
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
Do I have to tug your leash?

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,720
-Hey, Blondie.
-I'm Blondie?

53
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,080
You are. Jack and Coke times two.

54
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,320
-Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.
-Times two.

55
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
-What are you doing?
-I'm... regarding you.

56
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,160
I feel like I'm being analysed.

57
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,080
-Why the glasses?
-Um...

58
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,480
I like them. They totally work on you.
But do you need them?

59
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,240
-Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
-Knew it!

60
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
I used to wear them in school.

61
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
So I guess now
they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

62
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,320
I figured they were
kind of a fashion statement.

63
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,840
-Really?
-But then the rest of your outfit is not.

64
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,760
Don't take that wrong.
It's refreshing. I mean, look around.

65
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,080
People try so hard to look
how they think they should look.

66
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,000
They probably saw it in some movie.

67
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,880
But I like these.

68
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,240
You're authentically you.

69
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Thanks.

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Cheers.

71
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,760
You never tasted it before?

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
No, I...

73
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
I just haven't had it in a while.
It's good.

74
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
Do you live here?

75
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
-No. Oh, uh--
-Tourist?

76
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,920
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

77
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,800
-First night.
-First night? Wow, okay!

78
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,840
Oh, my God!

79
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,600
We<i> have</i> to dance to this.

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
-With each other?
-Uh-huh.

81
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,480
-Oh, no. Dance floors aren't my thing.
-Oh, let's not limit ourselves.

82
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,840
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can, come on.

83
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,800
-No, I'll look dumb--
-Just follow my lead!

84
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,280
Copy me.

85
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
You got it.

86
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Hey!

87
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,960
-Why did you run away?
-Oh, sorry.

88
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,440
I... I said I'm not much of a dancer.

89
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,560
No shit.

90
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Like a frightened horse
on a frozen lake back there.

91
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm kidding. Half kidding.

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
Sorry I pushed you into it.

93
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Saturday nights once a week.
It's like no time. I get impatient.

94
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,960
No, no, it's not that. It's...

95
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,440
-Everyone was looking.
-Looking?

96
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,240
Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

97
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,360
Okay, one, folks are way less uptight
than they used to be.

98
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,120
And two, this is a party town.
No one's judging.

99
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,880
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

100
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,600
-You're stupid.
-Thank you!

101
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
-I've never been on a dance floor.
-Never?

102
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,760
As in the whole time
you've been alive never?

103
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Never.

104
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,760
What are you, like, Amish?

105
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,040
That's one sheltered existence
you got there.

106
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Yeah, well.

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
As far as my family's concerned,
I can't do anything.

108
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,560
Well, no one knows
about even half the shit I get up to.

109
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,360
With your folks, though,
it's from a place of love, though, right?

110
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,120
-They worry.
-They don't worry.

111
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,560
Just the concept of me enjoying myself
would blow their minds.

112
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,480
What would you like to do?
That you've never done?

113
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
Oh...

114
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,600
So many things.

115
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,680
San Junipero is a party town.

116
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,040
All up for grabs.

117
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
Midnight's two hours away.

118
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,240
Oh, that's not long.

119
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,880
Why waste time sitting here?

120
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,440
I, um...

121
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,560
-Listen...
-It's okay.

122
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,000
-No, I mean...
-Really, it's okay.

123
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,960
No, I'm, uh...
I'm engaged. I have a fiancé.

124
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,680
-He's called Greg.
-And is Greg here?

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,320
-No, he's--
-Elsewhere?

126
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Yeah.

127
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,960
Oh.

128
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,640
Wanna go to bed with me?

129
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,200
We could be back at mine in like...

130
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,840
I never did anything like that.

131
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
All the more reason.

132
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,160
Oh, you're nice.

133
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,960
-I can't.
-Okay.

134
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,760
-I just... I can't.
-I get it.

135
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,880
-I have to go.
-In this?

136
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,920
It's been really great to meet you.

137
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Likewise.

138
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Okay.

139
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,920
Okay.

140
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Okay.

141
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,880
Shit.

142
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,920
-What the hell, Wes?
-Look, I know I'm coming across--

143
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,720
-I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
-No, don't do that. Just...

144
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,440
-Then stop this.
-Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

145
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
How many girls do you think there are
in San Junipero?

146
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,680
Hundreds? Thousands?

147
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,800
I don't care.

148
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,480
I'm saying there's plenty
of other girls out there for you, Wes.

149
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,880
The locals? They're like dead people.

150
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,040
A little lively for dead people.

151
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,720
Look, I don't want some kind
of boring romance, okay?

152
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,600
Like, Jesus,
put us in a retirement home deal.

153
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,120
Well, if you're looking for someone
to fuck, there's options.

154
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,560
-Hang out at the Quagmire again.
-It's not just sex.

155
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
-It was just sex.
-No, we made a connection.

156
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,520
Wes, it was just sex.

157
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,840
-No--
-No roots.

158
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,200
We had fun.

159
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,080
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

161
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
-Hey.
-Hey.

162
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,200
Waiting for someone?

163
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
Not really.

164
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,080
I'll get you a drink?

165
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,160
Uh, yeah, sure.

166
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,280
So, uh... yeah,
it was microsurgery, I guess.

167
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,160
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

168
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,480
You know, I never got this song.
Kind of weird.

169
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,640
-Shall we dance?
-Sure.

170
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, I guess by the time
I'd put my mind to, like, computing.

171
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,560
You know, caught that first wave,
would have had a different story.

172
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Gotta use the bathroom.

173
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Okay.

174
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,920
-I don't know how to do this.
-Do what?

175
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,560
Just help me.

176
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,720
Can you just...

177
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,360
Just make this easy for me?

178
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,840
You wanna get in my car?

179
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,840
-How long have you been here?
-Sorry?

180
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,680
-How long have you been here?
-In San Junipero?

181
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,560
Uh... Couple of months.
Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

182
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

183
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Yeah.

184
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,600
Hey. You okay?

185
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,640
Yeah.

186
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,320
Stop!

187
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,040
Sorry, but...

188
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,960
Man, your face!

189
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
Wow.

190
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,720
-You like it?
-It's just so big.

191
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,480
Reminds me of where I grew up.

192
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,200
Miss your mom?

193
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,920
You have to show me.

194
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,200
-Okay.
-Okay.

195
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,360
You never slept with a woman before?

196
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,560
That's not a critique.
I mean, it was fucking awesome.

197
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,960
No, never with a woman.

198
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,600
Never with anyone.

199
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,560
Not anyone?

200
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,520
-What, in town or...?
-No. No one, nowhere.

201
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,360
-I guess you deflowered me.
-I deflowered you?

202
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,320
What is this? Merry England?

203
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,640
Shut up.

204
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,720
You've had relationships though.

205
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,600
Mnh-mnh.

206
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,680
Hello! You got a fiancé.

207
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,280
-It's complicated.
-Yeah, I'll say.

208
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,640
When did you know...

209
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,200
-that you liked women?
-I like men too.

210
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,920
Equal rights.

211
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Okay.

212
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,280
But when did you know?

213
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Do you always know?

214
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,160
I was married to a guy.
A long time, I was married.

215
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,600
I always knew.

216
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,520
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,

217
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,160
co-workers, friends,
some waitress that served me.

218
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,600
They were crushes.
God, they were crushes.

219
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
Never acted on any of it.

220
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
Never did anything.

221
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,440
I was in love with him.

222
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,440
I really was in love with him.

223
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,640
But he chose not to stick around.

224
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,760
So now it's me.
And I'm passing through.

225
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,200
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

226
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
I'm just gonna have a good time.

227
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,000
Time's nearly up.

228
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,840
Then let's lie here.

229
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,840
Excuse me?

230
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,120
Have you seen Kelly?

231
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,040
-What's that?
-Kelly.

232
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
I haven't seen her all night.

233
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,320
You tried the Quagmire?

234
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,240
What is the Quagmire?

235
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,760
-Whoa! Hey!
-I'm sorry!

236
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,640
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

237
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,960
Tucker's.

238
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,200
-Kelly's friend, huh?
-Do you know where to find her?

239
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,840
-How would I know that?
-You're her friend.

240
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,720
<i>-Was</i> a friend.
-Has she been here?

241
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
No.

242
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,440
You too, huh?

243
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Well...

244
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,120
Hey. Try a different time.

245
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,400
Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

246
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,560
She's worth the shot, right?

247
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,120
<i>Introducing the totally redesigned</i>
<i>Chrysler Cordoba.</i>

248
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,720
<i>All the luxury you expect is here.</i>

249
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,760
<i>But so is gas mileage...</i>

250
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,320
No, no, no.

251
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,520
-Hey.
-Hey.

252
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,240
Golden age, right?

253
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,600
-Right.
-You playing or...

254
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,800
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.

255
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,000
Maybe... next time.

256
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Kelly?

257
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,320
Yeah!

258
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,920
<i> You're beautiful!</i>

259
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,280
<i>-Select a song!</i>
-Hi.

260
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,920
Ladies' room.

261
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,240
Hey.

262
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,440
Hey. No, you--

263
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,560
Wait a minute.

264
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,240
Why are you here?

265
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

266
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,240
I like a change of music.

267
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,800
How the hell is this your era?

268
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,000
-You hid from me.
-One, I did not.

269
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,800
Two, I owe you zero.
And three... see point two.

270
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,840
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

271
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,120
You don't know who I am.

272
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,680
You don't know what this means.

273
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,880
This means fun.

274
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,920
Or it should. And this...

275
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,240
This is not fun, okay?

276
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,920
This is not fun.

277
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
So you don't feel bad?

278
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,320
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

279
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Have you seen a girl?
Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

280
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,200
Uh...

281
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,360
Oh, jeez.

282
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Hey.

283
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,160
Please tell me
you got your pain slider set to zero.

284
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Yeah, I think so.

285
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,400
-Okay, listen.
-How many of them are dead?

286
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,120
Like what percentage?

287
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,960
As in full-timers?

288
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,600
Eighty. Eighty-five.

289
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,360
I'm sorry.

290
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,640
-I'm not gonna jump.
-I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

291
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,280
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

292
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,920
I don't know, do feelings.

293
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,480
You freaked me out.

294
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,040
I don't want to like anyone.

295
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,160
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

296
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,600
It's that...

297
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,680
I don't know how long there is.

298
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,480
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.
For wanting something--

299
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,640
Next week it is.

300
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,840
I'm getting married.

301
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,800
Next week?

302
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,720
To nice Greg?

303
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,600
-Sure you're going through with that?
-I have to.

304
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,440
-You have to?
-Mm-hmm.

305
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,160
He really is a good guy.

306
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,320
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

307
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,560
they can't stop us.

308
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,160
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

309
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,200
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

310
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,680
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

311
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,120
What does that mean?

312
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,600
They tell me three months.

313
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,480
It's spread basically everywhere.

314
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,000
They said three months before
six months ago.

315
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,000
So, you know, what do they know?

316
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,680
Doesn't even taste of anything.

317
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,240
-But so you'll stay here after?
-No.

318
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,040
When I'm done, I am done.

319
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,360
But that's cra-- I mean...

320
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,680
-Why?
-Richard.

321
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
That's...

322
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,200
My husband's name was Richard.

323
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,760
He died just two years ago.

324
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,680
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

325
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Pass over.

326
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,960
Didn't take it.

327
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,560
-Didn't want to take it.
-Why wouldn't anyone take it?

328
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
He had his viewpoint.

329
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,400
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

330
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,160
and this place was one of them.

331
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,000
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

332
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,320
Shit.

333
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,840
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

334
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,760
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

335
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,800
-Yeah, you could have.
-No, I wouldn't.

336
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,120
-We could have met outside all this.
-No.

337
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,560
You... would not have got me at all.

338
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
At all.

339
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,680
If we really met, I mean...

340
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,160
If we<i> really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

341
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,080
Try me.

342
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,440
Or you'd--
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

343
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
-You'd come and then--
-Try me.

344
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Why?

345
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,440
Why? What's the point?

346
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,640
What? Where are you? Houston?

347
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,360
Carson City, Nevada.

348
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,480
So come on.

349
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,640
I showed you mine.

350
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,520
Where are you?

351
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,040
-I can just look it up.
-Santa Rosa, California.

352
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,840
-That's no distance.
-I don't want you to--

353
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,040
-I don't want you to see me. I'm scared--
-And I'm dying.

354
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,040
Whatever you are can't scare me.

355
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,360
Let me come visit.

356
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,920
I want to say hi.

357
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,840
Here you go.

358
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,360
You okay?

359
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,640
<i>Please check in at our self-service pods</i>

360
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,520
<i>using swipe cards provided.</i>

361
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,280
-You must be Kelly.
-I guess I must.

362
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
-She's waiting for you.
-Thank you.

363
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,400
Please.

364
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,960
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

365
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,880
But she can hear you.

366
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,000
I'll give you some privacy.

367
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,320
Hello, stupid.

368
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,240
It's good to see you.

369
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,160
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

370
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,040
It is.

371
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,280
-I'm Greg.
-You're Greg?

372
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,680
Holy shit.

373
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,520
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

374
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,880
before she passes over.

375
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

376
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,080
She's passing over?

377
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,040
-When?
-Uh...

378
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,480
-Let's go grab a coffee.
-Okay.

379
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,160
-She didn't tell you?
-No, she did not.

380
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,760
-Said she was just visiting.
-More like sampling the trial version.

381
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,480
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

382
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,520
We talk on the comm box.

383
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,240
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

384
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,160
And how long she's been that way?

385
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,280
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

386
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,040
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

387
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,880
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

388
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,040
It's not natural and so forth.

389
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,160
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

390
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,360
-When she was 21?
-More than 40 years back.

391
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,480
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

392
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,080
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

393
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,680
The biggest deal.

394
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,680
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

395
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,160
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

396
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,120
I guess you're the same.

397
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,680
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

398
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,760
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

399
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,720
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

400
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,840
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already.

401
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,160
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

402
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,200
immersive nostalgia therapy.

403
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,800
Plunge you into a world of memories.

404
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,880
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

405
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,200
Small mercies.

406
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,840
So...

407
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,880
About this marriage...

408
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,200
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

409
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,400
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

410
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,880
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

411
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,800
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

412
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,080
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

413
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,400
But a spouse can override them.

414
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,600
-Hence the wedding bells.
-You got it.

415
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,720
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

416
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,640
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

417
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,080
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

418
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
If you can call it dying.

419
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,360
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

420
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,520
I guess.

421
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,680
You gonna wear a suit?

422
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,960
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

423
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,840
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

424
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,240
You're a good man.

425
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,720
It's the least I could do, right?

426
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,560
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

427
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,680
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

428
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,360
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

429
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,280
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

430
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,520
I know, but can you?

431
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,200
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every--

432
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,240
I only want a moment.

433
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
Ma'am.

434
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,320
-You got five minutes
-Thank you.

435
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,160
Hey!

436
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,520
I've never been here
during the daylight.

437
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,520
It's warm.

438
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,240
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

439
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,440
Oh.

440
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,600
-You're passing over tomorrow?
-Yeah.

441
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,400
Couple of hours after the wedding.

442
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,560
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

443
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,280
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

444
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,400
-I'm gonna say something crazy.
-Okay.

445
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,200
Wanna marry me instead?

446
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,160
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

447
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,800
Why not someone you've connected with?

448
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,640
Is that a yes?

449
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,160
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

450
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,400
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

451
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,280
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

452
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,600
Hold tight.

453
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,240
There you go.

454
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Nearly there.

455
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,800
That's it.

456
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,800
Are you sure you're all right?

457
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,880
Hey!

458
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,600
You didn't dress up to see me?

459
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,360
Oh...

460
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,880
Come on!

461
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,120
Better?

462
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,240
Whoop!

463
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,640
Oh!

464
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,800
Oh! Whoo!

465
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,520
Looks so real.

466
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,560
It feels so real!

467
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,320
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here!

468
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,400
I just love it.

469
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,160
-You've been here before.
-But now I live here!

470
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,960
Be with me.

471
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,920
-I'm with you now.
-That's not what I mean.

472
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,200
Pass over.

473
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,480
-When it's your time.
-Yorkie.

474
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,920
-Stay here with me.
-Can we just enjoy tonight?

475
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's almost midnight.

476
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,440
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

477
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,160
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

478
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,360
-You know I'm just a visitor.
-What, a couple of months, then what?

479
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,160
-We're not discussing this.
-Then you're gone.

480
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,080
-Just gone. You could have forever.
-Forever?

481
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,400
-Who can even make sense of forever?
-However long you want then.

482
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,080
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that.

483
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,960
It's not a trap.

484
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,440
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

485
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,840
-I'm going.
-Hey! Oh. Hey.

486
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,720
It's real.

487
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,280
This is real.

488
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,520
And this.

489
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,560
-Hmm?
-Come on.

490
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,480
You know that was just a gesture.

491
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,160
-You married me.
-To help you pass over.

492
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,120
-As a... kindness.
-It's not so kind to leave.

493
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,160
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

494
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,960
I got this chance.

495
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,840
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

496
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,880
I said I made my choice.

497
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,080
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

498
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,760
-Because that was his choice.
-Don't.

499
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,520
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

500
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,560
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

501
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,920
-You don't know what you're saying.
-You should be mad at him.

502
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,040
-Not whipping yourself with guilt.
-Get off me.

503
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,000
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

504
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,120
Forty-nine years...

505
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,560
I was with him for 49 years.

506
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,160
You can't begin to imagine.

507
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,880
You can't know...

508
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,280
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

509
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,720
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

510
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,360
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

511
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,480
Everything we sacrificed.

512
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,440
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

513
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,880
Did you think to ask?

514
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,440
Did it occur to you to ask?

515
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,400
We had a daughter.

516
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,360
Alison.

517
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,160
Always difficult, always beautiful.

518
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,960
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

519
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,120
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

520
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,320
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

521
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,600
-Well, I didn't know--
-Didn't think to.

522
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,680
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

523
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,400
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

524
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,160
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

525
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,920
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

526
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,400
And so he went.

527
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,800
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

528
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,520
that they're together, but I don't.

529
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,440
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

530
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,120
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

531
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,600
Now you give me some sales pitch

532
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,560
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

533
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,680
I'm sorry.

534
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,960
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

535
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,840
End up like Wes?

536
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,040
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

537
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,200
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

538
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,200
But I'm out. I'm gone.

539
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,160
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

540
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,200
Hey, Kelly.

541
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,200
-You all right?
-Yeah, I am fine.

542
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,040
-Well, okay then.
-Huh?

543
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,480
Kelly?

544
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,720
All things considered...

545
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,200
I guess I'm ready.

546
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,840
For what?

547
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,120
For the rest of it.

548
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,280
Ready?
