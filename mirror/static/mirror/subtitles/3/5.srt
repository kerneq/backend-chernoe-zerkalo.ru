Something went down last night
in Her Falls,

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,300
a village about three miles east.

10
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,740
We've got reports of a food store
broken into, shit stolen.

11
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,140
Locals think it's roaches.

[woman] Roaches!

13
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,540
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!
[claps]

It's Stripe.

Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

21
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,780
- with one of them roaches today.
- Uh-huh?

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,300
When you see one right here,

23
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

- I'll try.
- Try to ignore Len.

His aim's so bad,
he's the only guy on Earth

who could shit his own pants and miss.

[whispering continues]

64
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Okay. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,300
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

66
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,660
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

67
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,060
Anderson, Hague, I want you
to stay here and help them torch the food,

68
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,540
keep them calm and reassured.

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,900
The rest of you,
we're gonna drop in on Heidekker.

70
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,900
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,740
If there's roaches,
we show we're ready for them. Let's go.

72
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,860
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

73
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,380
Seems like mental health issues.

74
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,180
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

76
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,940
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

77
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,300
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,060
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

79
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,620
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,660
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

81
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,580
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

82
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,620
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

83
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,500
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

84
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
No wonder it's taken so long
to mop shit up.

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,060
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

86
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,420
Hell, yeah.

- [man] Check.

96
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,780
Check.

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,100
[woman] Aikin, Valcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

98
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,660
Take them one at a time and slow.

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,420
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

100
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,860
We go in here.

101
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,740
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

102
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,260
Okay.

103
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,420
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

104
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,740

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,660
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

109
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Okay.

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,340
- What is it you want?
- Just to talk.

111
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,780
That's what we're doing.

112
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,820
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

113
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,900
Check the upstairs rooms.

114
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,500
[woman] Relax. I'm not your enemy.

115
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,340
Where are they?

116
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,540
Where are who?

117
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
You know, we got a whole bunch

118
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,460
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

119
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,980
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

120
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,220
You know anything about that?

121
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
No.

122
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,700
[woman]
See, it's not just what they stole.

123
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,420
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

124
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,420
- No one's gonna eat it.

Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

127
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,020
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

128
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,100
I agree. All life is sacred so...

129
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,300
you even got to protect the roaches.
Right?

130
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,220
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

131
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,700
I get it. We get it.

132

134
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,020
[woman] There's shit
in their blood that made them that way.

135
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,660
The sickness they're carrying.

136
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,780
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

137
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,020
or the pain
about who else is gonna suffer.

138
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,940
We don't stop the roaches,
in five, ten, 20 years from now,

139
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,860
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

140
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Bingo.

141
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,820
[woman]
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

142
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,660
That sickness,
and it could have been avoided.

143
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,900
Fucking roach nest.

144
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,820
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

145
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,780
[woman] Every roach you save today,

146
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,940
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

147
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,100
You can't still see them as human.

148
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,940
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

149
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,460
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

150
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,580
That's just the hard truth.

151
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,620
Gotta make sacrifices.

322
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,820
- Just relief?
- Uh-huh.

323
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,580
It's not unusual to experience
other feelings too.

324
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,140
A moment of euphoria even.

325
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,660
Yeah, I guess.

326
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,260
I don't know,
I thought maybe I'd feel...

327
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
I don't know.

328
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,340
- Something else?
- Yeah, like...

329
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,380
Regret. Something like that,
but that just wasn't there.

330
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,540
Hmm.

331
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,860
So you'd do it again?

332
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Yeah, sure.

333
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,300
So... why are you here? [laughs]

334
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,980
I don't know. I mean...

335
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,460
I had a few weird moments.

336
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,380
My Mass looked like it was glitching out.

337
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,420
But your implants,
I mean, they passed every diagnostic.

338
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,980
- There is nothing wrong with that?
- Yeah, they said it's fine.

339
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,620
I don't know, I think I just...

340
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,100
Felt like something was up with it.

341
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,060
- But there's not.
- No.

342
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,580
[both laugh]

343
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,340
You did a big thing.
You should be proud of yourself.

344
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,700
Okay?

345
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,500
It'll pass.

346
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,300
Let's get you a good sleep tonight, huh?

347
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,380
A real good sleep.

348
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,060
[echoes] Fuck me.

349
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,700

- Way to go, fuck fingers.
- [scoffs]

362
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,140
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

363
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,540
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

364
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,860
[Raiman] Well, all right.

365
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,020
[woman] It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

366
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,180
It's not far from here.

367
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,380
So control wants us to do recon
before we go back to base.

368
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,900
Can we hurry it up here?

369
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,460
We ought to burn the whole forest down,
huh?

370
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,300
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

371
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,140
[whirring]

372
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,300
Okay, you see that?

373
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,140
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

374
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,220
And there are some cables.

375
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,980
- There's got to be roaches leaching power.
- Why here?

376
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,180
[high-pitched whistling]

377
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,660
Christ knows.

378
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
All right.

379
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,300
Better dial it in.

380
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,380
[groans quietly]

381
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,900
[groans]

382
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,860
Control. This is Medina.

383
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,180
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

384
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,180
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

385
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,860
- Roger so far.
- [sniffing]

386
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,700
- You all right there?
- Smell the grass.

387
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,660
We can't usually smell nothing.

388
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,180
- You ever noticed that?
- [Raiman] No, I never noticed that.

389
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,300
[Medina] Requesting course of action.

390
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,100
Didn't read. Please repeat.

391
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Okay.

392
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,660
Control says we should fall back
and await comm...

393
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,300
- [gunfire]
- [Raiman] Shit!

[gunshot]

395
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,900
Medina.

[gunshot]

397
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,700

- Oh!

398
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,260
Medina. [panting]

399
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,060
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

400
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,100
[Stripe whimpers]

401
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,940
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

402
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,420
Rai! Rai, come on.

403
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,020
Okay.

404
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,380
[whirring]

405
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,900
Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

406
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,140
Fuck. Piece of shit.

407
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,060
Okay, Stripe.

408
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,580
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

409
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,980
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

410
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,300
- Should take him ten seconds to reload.
- We go in?

411
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,780
We go in and take him out.
Are you with me?

412
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,900
- I'm with you.
- Let's go!

413
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,100
- [gunfire]
- Follow me!

414

Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

Let's go.

It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

430

- Go on, get out of here. Go on.
- [panting]

00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,020
Roaches don't speak.

487
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,340
You just can't hear us.

488
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,020
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Your implants. Your army implants.

489
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,780
The Mass system?

490
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,180
They put it in your head to help you fight,

491
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,220
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

492
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,380
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

493
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,900
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

494
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,340
You're roaches?

495
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,580
But I've seen roaches.

496
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,420
I've seen them, they're fucking...
They're like, uh...

497
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,780
- Animals?
- No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

498
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,860
The implant made you see this.

499
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,260
[groans]

500
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,300
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

501
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,500
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

502
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,140
They're scared of the roaches.

503
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,340
- They hate the fucking things.
- Everybody hates us.

504
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,980
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

505
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,820
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

506
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,620
What you see now.

507
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,820
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

508
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,100
[cocks gun]

509

[birds squawking]

511
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,740
Ten years ago, it began.

512
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,260
Post-war.

513
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,340
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks,

514
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,820
then the register,
the emergency measures.

515
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,780
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

516
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,780
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

517
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,460
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

518
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,460
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

519
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,380
They say that our blood cannot go on.

520
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,620
That we cannot go on.

521
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,020
My name was Catarina.

522
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,460
He was Alec.

523
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,260
Now we're just roach.

524
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,100
But now...

525
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,660
Now you see me.

526
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,380
Now you see me.

527
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,300
Rai?

528
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,620
- Rai, no!

00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,620
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

532
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,180
- None of it's true, Rai.
- What the fuck got you?

533
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,500
None of it's true.

Get up. Back against the wall.

00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,540
Get up!

538
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,300
You want me to come in there?

539
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,060
[Arquette]
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

540
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,900
[door opens]

541
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,020
Thank you, Briley.

542
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,900
[door closes]

543
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,380
Stripe.

544
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,980
We owe you an apology.
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

545
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,820
I got you a coffee.

546
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,900
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

547
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,900
Is this the thing?

548
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,180
We found it on an old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

549
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,740
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

550
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,060
The light here transmits a code.
It's like a virus.

551
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,180
It burrows into your Mass,
trying to shut it down from within.

552
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,140
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

553
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,460
than we give them credit for.

554
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,900
The whole thing is a lie.

555
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,780
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

556
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,180
Roaches.

557
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,220
They look just like us.

558
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,500
Of course they do.

559
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,540
That's why they're so dangerous.

560
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,780
Humans.
You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

561
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,860
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

562
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,940
I mean, we don't actually really want
to kill each other. [laughs]

563
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,940
Which is a good thing.

564
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,540
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

565
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,860
Come on, sit down.

566
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,380
[groans]

567
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,220
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

568
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,860
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century,

569
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,900
most soldiers
didn't even fire their weapons.

570
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,620
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

571
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,940
They did it on purpose.

572
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,300
British Army. World War I.

573
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,820
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

574
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,780
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

575
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,820
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

576
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,900
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

577
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,380
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

578
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,060
Now what does that tell you?

579
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,340
It tells me that that war
would have been over a whole lot quicker

580
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,820
had the military got its shit together.

581
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,300
So we adapted.

582
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,540
Better training. Better conditioning.

583
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,140
Then comes the Vietnam War,

584
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,100
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

585
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,700
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

586
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,540
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

587
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,500
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

588
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,380
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until Mass came along.

589
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,540
You see, Mass...
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

590
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,020
It helps you with your intel.

591
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,780
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

592
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:29,060
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

593
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,100
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

594
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,020
You don't hear the shrieks.

595
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,980
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

596
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,700
They're human beings.

597
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,700
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

598
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,660
Higher rates of cancer.

599
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,860
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

600
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,100
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

601
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,220
It's all there.

602
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,300
The screening shows it.

603
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,620
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

604
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,580
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

605
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,860
The villagers won't do it.

606
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,220
The folks back home won't do it.

607
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,740
They don't have Mass.

608
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,780
Mass lets you do it.

609
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,660
You.

610
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,020
You're protecting the bloodline.

611
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,140
And that, my friend, is an honour.

612
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,380
There's no honour here.

613
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,380
It's just killing.

614
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,860
- Lying and killing.
- No one lied to you.

615
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,220
You knew all of this. All along.

616
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,900
What are you talking about?

617
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,580
You agreed
to have your Mass implant put in.

618
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,540
- [laughs]
- Set up. Every soldier does.

619
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,060
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

620
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,420
You have to accept it. Willingly.

621
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,420
It's exactly what you did.

622
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,300
[man] <i>So you see the terms
and conditions there?</i>

623
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,140
<i>Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.</i>

624
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,020
What is that?

625
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,660
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

626
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,140
[man] <i>Basically, it says you agree
to Mass implant activation.</i>

627
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,740
- I didn't do this.
- Yes, you did.

628
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,180
- [man] <i>Works kind of like hypnosis.</i>
- <i>Yeah, all right.</i>

629
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,540
[man] <i>Part of what you're agreeing to
is not realising</i>

630
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,020
<i>you've been put in this state.</i>

631
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,420
<i>If you follow me.
You won't recall this conversation.</i>

632
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,660
<i>That's kind of funny, man.</i>

633
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,260
Turn it off.

634
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,620
- [man] <i>So for you to register consent...</i>
- Turn it off, man.

635
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,380
<i>I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.</i>

636
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,740
- <i>Right here?</i>
- [man] <i>Yes, please.</i>

637
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,540
<i>That's dope.</i>

638
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,060
<i>[faint beeping]</i>

639
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,420
I didn't do that!

640
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,180
[faint beeping]

641
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,180
- I don't remember that!
- Just like the man said.

642
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,140

643
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,820
- I know you're upset.
- Fuck you!

644
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,700
- What's happening?
- We control what you see, Stripe.

645
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,900
- I can't see nothing.
- Because we control it.

646
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,500
Give me my fucking eyes back.

647
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,180
- Let me lay out your options.
- Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

648
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,460
- [grunts]
- Let me lay out your options!

649
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,940
[breathes heavily]

650
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,660
Option one,
you agree to have your Mass reset.

651
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,820
All the recollections
of the past few days,

652
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,180
including this conversation, erased.

653
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,660
No way.

654
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,580
Option two's incarceration.

655
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,620
- I'd advise you to consider.
- Fuck you!

656
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,380
Mass is a friend.

657
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,620
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

658
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,500
I ain't having this Mass shit.

659
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,420
No more. No way.

660
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,620
Okay.

661
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,580
Well...

662
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,900
Maybe you should see
what life would be like without it.

663
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,540
[beeps]

664
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,380
[Stripe] What's happening?

665
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,020
Where am I?

666
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,340
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

667
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,060
I have it all logged, Stripe.
We can feed you everything that you did.

668
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,540
Hey, no, no, no. No.

669
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,620
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!
Please! Please don't shoot.

670
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,740
- Please! Please!
- No! No!

671
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,380
No. Make it stop.

672
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,420
- No! Please.
- [whirring]

673
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,380
Make it stop!

674
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,420
- Please!
- [gunfire]

675
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,380
No! No!

676
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,580
[gasps]

677
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,660
- [screams]
- [gasps] No!

678
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,140
[whimpers]

679
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,260
- [stabbing sounds]
- [screams]

680
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,020
Fuck off! Stop it!

681
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,340
- [stabbing sound]
- [groans]

682
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,380
- [stabbing sound]
- No!

683
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,900
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

684
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,940
Is this what you want?

685
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,580
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

686
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,060
[whimpers]

687
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,700
[beeps]

688
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,740
[Stripe whimpering]

689
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,380
[Arquette] We can make that go away.

690
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,140
This conversation goes away too.

691
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,420
All of it.

692
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,700
But you gotta say the word.

693
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,860
Just say the word, Stripe.

694
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,740
And it all goes away.

695
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,020
Just say the word.

696
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:48,961
